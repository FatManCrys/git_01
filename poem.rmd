## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
The sun was shining on the sea,   
Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make   
The billows smooth and bright—   
And this was odd, because it was   
The middle of the night.

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
I want to hear your voice,   
To feel the warmth of your smile, But no matter how hard I try,   
I can’t seem to reach you.   
   
The world is so silent,    
It feels like I’m alone,   
In this endless quiet,    
I’m lost, and I’m afraid.    
    
Please don’t leave me here,    
Help me find my way back.
